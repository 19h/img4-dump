`img4-dump` is a command-line utility for low-level analysis of Apple's IMG4 firmware format. It parses IMG4 containers and their standalone components (IM4P payloads, IM4M manifests), extracts all embedded data, and provides tools for decryption and decompression. Its primary function is to support security research and reverse engineering of firmware for Apple devices.

### Installation

```shell
cargo install img4-dump --features lzfse,lzss
```
*Note: The `--features lzfse,lzss` flags are recommended to enable all decompression capabilities.*

### Usage Examples

**1. Basic Dump (Metadata and Payloads)**
Extracts all components from an `.img4` file into the `dump_output/` directory with verbose logging.

```shell
img4-dump -v my_firmware.img4 -o dump_output
```

**2. Decrypt Payload with Command-Line IV and Key**
Decrypts the IM4P payload using a specified AES-256 key in CTR mode.

```shell
img4-dump --decrypt \
  --aes-mode ctr \
  --iv 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef \
  --key 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff \
  -o decrypted_firmware \
  firmware.im4p
```

**3. Decrypt and Decompress**
Decrypts using keys from a plaintext KBAG within the IM4P, then attempts to decompress the result using LZFSE or LZSS.

```shell
img4-dump --decrypt --decompress -o processed_firmware firmware_with_kbag.im4p
```

**4. Full Manifest Analysis**
Dumps the raw IM4M, extracts its full property list to JSON, and saves the embedded certificate chain as individual `.der` and `.pem` files.

```shell
img4-dump --dump-im4m --dump-im4m-props --dump-im4m-certs \
  -o manifest_analysis \
  my_firmware.img4
```

**5. JSON Summary Output**
Parses the input file and prints a structured JSON summary of its contents to standard output.

```shell
img4-dump --json my_firmware.img4 > summary.json
```

### Features

*   **Comprehensive Parsing:** Handles `IMG4` containers, standalone `IM4P` payloads, and standalone `IM4M` manifests.
*   **Component Extraction:** Dumps the raw DER-encoded bytes of the IM4P, IM4M, and IM4R components.
*   **AES Decryption:** Decrypts IM4P payloads using user-supplied IV and Key.
    *   Supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.
    *   Supports Counter (CTR) and Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) modes.
    *   Automatically reads IV/Key from plaintext `KBAG` tags if present in the IM4P.
*   **Decompression:** Optionally decompresses decrypted payloads using LZFSE or LZSS algorithms (requires feature flags).
*   **Manifest Analysis:**
    *   Extracts the complete property list from an IM4M into a structured JSON file.
    *   Dumps the full X.509 certificate chain used for signature validation.
*   **Flexible Output:** Provides verbose logging for detailed analysis and a machine-readable JSON summary for automation.

### Technical Background

The IMG4 format is a container structure used by Apple for distributing and verifying firmware components. It is based on ASN.1 DER (Abstract Syntax Notation One, Distinguished Encoding Rules), a standard for encoding structured data.

A typical `IMG4` file contains three main components:

1.  **IM4P (Image Payload):** The core data file, such as a kernel (`krnl`), bootloader (`ibot`), or Secure Enclave processor firmware (`sepi`).
    *   **Structure:** An ASN.1 `SEQUENCE` containing a four-character code (4CC) type, a description string, the payload data (octet string), and an optional `KBAG` tag.
    *   **Encryption:** The payload data is often encrypted with AES. The `KBAG` (keybag) tag contains the necessary decryption IV and the AES key. In production firmware, the key within the KBAG is "wrapped" (encrypted) with a device-specific hardware key (GID key). **This tool requires a plaintext KBAG or a user-supplied raw key; it does not perform GID key unwrapping.**
    *   **AES Mode:** The AES block cipher mode (e.g., CTR, CBC) is not specified within the format. The user must determine the correct mode for the target payload via other analysis.

2.  **IM4M (Image Manifest):** A cryptographically signed manifest that ensures the integrity and authenticity of the IM4P.
    *   **Structure:** An ASN.1 `SEQUENCE` containing properties like the payload's SHA hash (`DGST`), security domain (`SDOM`), and various other boot-time parameters.
    *   **Verification:** The manifest is signed by Apple, and the signature is verified by the device's Boot ROM or a preceding bootloader stage against a chain of trust rooted in an Apple hardware certificate. This tool can extract the certificate chain but does not perform signature validation.

3.  **IM4R (Image Restore Info):** An opaque data blob related to the device restore process. This tool extracts it without further interpretation.

### Output File Structure

When run, `img4-dump` creates the following files in the specified output directory (names are examples):

*   `im4p.bin`: The raw, possibly encrypted, IM4P payload.
*   `im4p.kbag.der`: The raw DER of the KBAG tag, if present.
*   `im4p.ciphertext`: A copy of the encrypted payload, if `--keep-ciphertext` is used.
*   `im4p.decrypted`: The plaintext payload after successful decryption.
*   `im4p.decompressed.lzfse`: The final data after LZFSE decompression.
*   `im4m.der`: The raw DER of the IM4M manifest.
*   `im4m.props.json`: A JSON representation of all key-value properties within the manifest.
*   `im4m.cert.0.der`, `im4m.cert.0.pem`, ...: The certificate chain from the manifest.
*   `im4r.der`: The raw IM4R data blob.

### Notes

*   If you intend to analyze the executable code within a decrypted payload, note that modern Apple devices use 64-bit ARMv8-A architecture (AArch64). Embedded micro-controllers (e.g., in peripherals) may use other architectures like ARMv7-M (e.g., Arm Cortex-M series).
*   The decryption validation logic is heuristic-based. It checks for common file magic numbers and data entropy patterns. It is a best-effort check and not a guarantee of correctness. Always verify the decrypted output.
